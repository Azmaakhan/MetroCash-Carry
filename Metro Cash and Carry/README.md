# Project Title: FarmSim

## Introduction:
FarmSim is a comprehensive farm simulation application designed to empower users with the tools and knowledge to manage a virtual farm efficiently. This project aims to provide a realistic experience for farming enthusiasts and educate users about plant selection, weather impact, and the financial aspects of farming.

## Objectives:
- To create an interactive farm simulation using Java Swing that incorporates elements like soil quality, weather data, seed selection, and water management.
- To enable users to forecast the best plant options based on the provided soil and weather conditions.
- To fetch real plant data via APIs for a more authentic experience.
- To generate visual representations of the farm's cost and profit using graphs.
- To facilitate garden design sharing through a text file, allowing users to share and adapt designs.

## Problem Solving:
Farmers often struggle with making informed decisions on crop selection, which can lead to financial losses and resource wastage. FarmSim addresses this issue by providing a virtual environment for experimenting with different crops, soil types, and weather conditions. It educates users about the impact of these factors on farming, helping them make better real-life decisions.
